# WhatsAppbot
#### ~~It's hosted online but at what cost?~~
## How to access the bot
#### 1. ~~Add this number ```+1 (415) 523-8886```~~ 
#### 2. ~~Send this command to connect yourself to the bot (twilio sandbox) ```join serve-comfortable```~~ 
#### 3. ~~Now send a "hello"~~

(run it locally!)

-----------------------------------------------------------
**As heroku started charging for hosting, this bot is no longer in use. Therefore, the accessing method mentioned above will not work**<br>
*PS: there are also better ways to build a similar bot by writing more efficient and less repetitive code. Unfortunately i won't be fixing any bugs or issues for this repo, however (anyone) is free to use this repo for your bot's reference*<br><br>
thank you !
